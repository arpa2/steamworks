This directory contains the documentation and sources for the
pulley-component of SteamWorks. See http://steamworks.arpa2.net/pulley.html
for a general description.

The pulley copies and transforms one upstream LDAP DIT to a
configuration for a single machine (e.g. produces configuration
files). Currently, it is in a very experimental state.
