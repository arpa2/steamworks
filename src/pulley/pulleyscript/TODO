+ Turn conditions into indexed tables
+ Store driver structures (in tables)
+ Make lexer and parser re-entrant, and use a global script semantics structure
+ Parser should insert values into storage structures
+ Output pretty prints of intermediate states of various structures
+ Perform semantic analysis, by calculating the result sets of script semantics
- Generator should create right-size paths -- or have resist.c plug it in
- Support path scheduling from a driver without generator (for pull mode)
- Produce vars/gens/conds_needed for path_schedule() in path_have_push/_pull()
- Actually make the path iterator functions work
- In path_run() actually generate the values of variables
+ In path_run() actually send values to the output drivers
