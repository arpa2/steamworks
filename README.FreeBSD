This SteamWorks software is compatible with FreeBSD and has been
tested on FreeBSD 10-STABLE, 10.1-R and 10.2-R. In order to build
SteamWorks locally, you will need the following packages installed:

	fcgi-devkit (optional)
	log4cpp
	openldap-client

SteamWorks builds with both clang (default on the tested FreeBSD
versions) and gcc.

SteamWorks can build a bundled copy of FCGI if needed, so fcgi-devkit
is optional.
