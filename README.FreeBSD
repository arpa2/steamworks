This SteamWorks software is compatible with FreeBSD and has been
tested on FreeBSD 10-STABLE, 10.1-R and 10.2-R. In order to build
SteamWorks locally, you will need the following packages installed:

	log4cpp
	openldap-client
	sqlite3

SteamWorks builds with both clang (default on the tested FreeBSD
versions) and gcc.

SteamWorks builds a bundled copy of FCGI, so fcgi-devkit is not needed.
