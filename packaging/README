This directory holds packaging (meta)data for various target platforms.
Each subdirectory contains whatever files are needed to package up
the SteamWorks software on the given platform; these will typically
be duplicated into a platform's packaging system or repository
(e.g. the FreeBSD directory gets duplicated into the official
ports tree as security/steamworks).
