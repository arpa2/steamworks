# LDAP notes 2016-03-06

Enabling SyncRepl on an OpenLDAP server is straightforward.
You may be misled by the server, though: it will report
supported server control 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.9.1.1 (SyncRepl)
even if it isn't actually enabled in the server.

This is noticeable when you use the Shaft, and enable a
downstream. This causes a SyncRepl search to be started
*upstream*. If the server isn't configured for SyncRepl,
you will see: Sync setup result 12 Critical extension is unavailable.

See [syncrepl refreshAndPersist using slapd.conf][1] for simple
setup instructions.
