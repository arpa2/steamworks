This repository holds notes and code for the initial implementation
of parts of the SteamWorks system, in particular the Crank, Shaft and
Pulley parts of that system.

See LICENSE for overall licensing information, and a README in each 
subdirectory for local details. See README.<os> for details regarding 
SteamWorks on a particular operating system and for build dependencies. 
For a quick start (assuming the build dependencies are met; otherwise 
you will get error messages that point out what is missing), just run

    make

to create a build directory, configure and build the system.

The documentation is written in MarkDown. There is a docs/Makefile that 
will produce nicer output using ronn(1).

For example usage of the system, see the examples/ directories in the 
various components directories. These contain example data and scenario's 
to demonstrate the system; you will need to read some of the documentation 
in docs/ to know what to do with them.
