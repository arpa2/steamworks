See LICENSE for overall licensing information, and a README in each
subdirectory for local details. See README.<os> for details regarding
SteamWorks on a particular operating system and for build dependencies.
For a quick start (assuming the build dependencies are met; otherwise
you will get error messages that point out what is missing), just run

    make

to create a build directory, configure and build the system. For example
usage of the system, see the examples/ directories in the various
components directories.
