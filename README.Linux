This SteamWorks software is compatible with Linux and has been
tested on OpenSUSE OpenSUSE 13.2. In order to build SteamWorks,
you will need to install the following packages:

 - OpenSUSE
   - Packages (use zypper install)
     - gcc-c++
     - openldap-client, openldap-client-devel
   - From source:
     - log4cpp, see http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/ .
       This is optional.

SteamWorks builds a bundled copy of FCGI, so fcgi-devkit is not needed.
